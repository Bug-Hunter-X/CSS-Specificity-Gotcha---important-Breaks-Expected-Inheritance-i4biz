The solution avoids the use of `!important` by restructuring the CSS rules to prioritize expected inheritance. A more specific rule targets the nested span, and the inheritance chain is preserved without the unexpected overriding of `font-size`.  Instead of the `!important` declaration, the specificity of the selector is adjusted to correctly target the nested `<span>`:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container div {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.container div span {
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

This approach ensures that the styles are applied predictably and maintainably, and it avoids the potential pitfalls of `!important`.
